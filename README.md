# Movie Recommendation System 🎬📽️

This project demonstrates a **Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies based on a user-provided movie title. The system uses TMDB (The Movie Database) data to find and recommend similar movies. The user can input the name of a movie and receive a list of related films based on the similarity of their genres, plot, and other features. The interface is built with **Streamlit**, making it user-friendly and interactive.

## 🌟 Overview
The **Movie Recommendation System** leverages the TMDB movie dataset and a recommendation algorithm to provide users with movie suggestions. By entering the name of a movie, users can receive a curated list of similar movies based on different factors such as genre, keywords, and user ratings.

### How it works:
1. The user inputs a movie title.
2. The system processes the input and fetches similar movies from the dataset using content-based filtering (considering genres, descriptions, keywords, etc.).
3. The system displays the top related movies as recommendations.

## ✨ Features
- **Simple and Intuitive Interface**: Built using Streamlit, allowing users to easily interact with the recommendation system.
- **Recommendations based on Similarity**: Using content-based filtering (similar genre, plot, etc.).
- **TMDB Data Integration**: Utilizes a rich dataset from TMDB.
- **Responsive Design**: Can be accessed from any device.

## 📊 Data
The project uses the **TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset** that contains:
- Movie titles
- Genres
- Plot descriptions
- Keywords
- Cast & crew information
- Ratings and more.
